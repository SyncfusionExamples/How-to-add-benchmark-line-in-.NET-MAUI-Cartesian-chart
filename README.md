# How to add a benchmark line to the .NET MAUI Cartesian Chart
A benchmark line in a chart is a horizontal or vertical line that represents a specific value or threshold. It is used to visually compare data points against this reference value. For example, a benchmark line can indicate a target sales figure, a minimum acceptable performance level, or any other significant threshold.

**Cartesian Chart**

A [Cartesian chart](https://www.syncfusion.com/maui-controls/maui-cartesian-charts) (or Cartesian coordinate chart) uses a rectangular coordinate system to plot data points on an X and Y axis. It is commonly used for displaying data in various formats, including line charts, bar charts, and scatter plots. The SfCartesianChart control from Syncfusion for .NET MAUI provides a flexible and powerful way to create these charts with various data visualization options.

**Column Series**

A [Column Series](https://help.syncfusion.com/maui/cartesian-charts/column) is a type of chart series where data points are represented as vertical bars (columns) extending from the X-axis. It is one of the most common and effective ways to visualize data, especially when comparing different categories or tracking changes over time.

**Annotations Support**

[Annotations](https://help.syncfusion.com/maui/cartesian-charts/annotation) in charts are graphical elements that can be added to provide additional information or highlight specific areas of the chart. They help in enhancing the interpretability of the chart by marking important data points, trends, or thresholds. Common types of annotations include lines, shapes, text, and images.


In this example, we will explore how to add the benchmark line for a Cartesian chart using the annotation feature and custom drawing method.

## Troubleshooting

If you are facing a path too long exception when building this example project, close Visual Studio and rename the repository to short and build the project.
